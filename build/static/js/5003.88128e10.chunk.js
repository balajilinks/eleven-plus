Key strategies: 1) Break the problem into smaller steps, 2) Work through each step carefully, 3) Use the answer from one step in the next step, 4) Check each step makes sense, 5) Verify your final answer. Remember the order of operations (BODMAS) and consider whether to work with exact values or round at the end.","questionFormations":{"description":"Multi-step calculation questions can appear in various complex formats that test logical thinking and sequential problem-solving:","types":[{"type":"Sequential Operations","examples":["Start with 50. Add 25, multiply by 3, subtract 15, then divide by 4. What\'s the result?","Calculate: (12 + 8) \xd7 5 - 30 \xf7 6"],"strategy":"Follow order of operations (BODMAS), work step by step, show intermediate results"},{"type":"Money and Shopping Problems","examples":["Buy 3 items at \xa34.50 each, pay with two \xa310 notes. How much change?","Cinema tickets: 2 adults (\xa38.50 each), 3 children (\xa35.25 each). Total cost and change from \xa350?"],"strategy":"Break into: calculate total cost, calculate payment, find difference"},{"type":"Area and Scale Factor Problems","examples":["Rectangle 6\xd74 cm enlarged to area 150 cm\xb2. Find the scale factor.","Square has area 64 cm\xb2. If enlarged by scale factor 1.5, what\'s the new perimeter?"],"strategy":"Calculate original measurement, apply scale factor correctly (area scales by factor\xb2)"},{"type":"Average Speed and Distance","examples":["Travel 180 km in 2.5 hours, then 120 km in 1.5 hours. Find average speed.","Journey: 80 km at 40 km/h, then 60 km at 30 km/h.
