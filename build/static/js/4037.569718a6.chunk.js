This is essential for using mathematical formulas in real life. Follow the order of operations (BODMAS/PEMDAS): Brackets, Orders (powers), Division/Multiplication (left to right), Addition/Subtraction (left to right). Be careful with negative numbers, use brackets when substituting negatives, and always show your working step by step. Common formulas include area, perimeter, speed, and algebraic expressions.","examples":[{"question":"If a = 3 and b = 5, find the value of 2a + 3b","solution":"21","explanation":"Replace a with 3 and b with 5: 2(3) + 3(5) = 6 + 15 = 21"},{"question":"The formula for the area of a triangle is A = \xbdbh.
