Transformations change the position or orientation of shapes: Translation (sliding), Reflection (flipping over a line), Rotation (turning around a point), and Enlargement (changing size). When reflecting, the shape flips over the mirror line and distances from the line stay the same.","examples":[{"question":"Point A is at (3, 2). What are its coordinates after reflection in the y-axis?","solution":"(-3, 2)","explanation":"When reflecting in the y-axis, the x-coordinate changes sign but the y-coordinate stays the same. So (3, 2) becomes (-3, 2)."},{"question":"Triangle ABC has vertices at A(1, 1), B(3, 1), C(2, 3). After translation by vector (2, -1), what are the new coordinates?","solution":"A\'(3, 0), B\'(5, 0), C\'(4, 2)","explanation":"Add the translation vector to each point: A(1+2, 1-1) = A\'(3, 0), B(3+2, 1-1) = B\'(5, 0), C(2+2, 3-1) = C\'(4, 2)."}],"exercises":[{"type":"multiple-choice","question":"Point P is at (4, -1).

When reflecting in the x-axis, (4, -1) becomes (4, 1).","This would be reflection in both axes, not just the x-axis.","This rotates the coordinates, which is not reflection."]},{"type":"multiple-choice","question":"A shape is translated by vector (3, -2).

B(2, 1) + (3, -2) = (2+3, 1-2) = (5, -1).","This subtracts the vector instead of adding it.","This only applies the x-translation, not the y-translation.","This applies the wrong vector."]}]}')}}]);
