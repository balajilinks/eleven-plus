Key strategies: 1) Read carefully and identify what you\'re looking for, 2) Identify the given information, 3) Decide which operations to use, 4) Work step by step, 5) Check your answer makes sense in the context. Look for key words like \'total\', \'difference\', \'each\', \'altogether\', \'left\', \'more than\', \'less than\'.","examples":[{"question":"A school has 480 students. 2/5 of them are girls. How many boys are there?","solution":"288 boys","explanation":"Girls: 2/5 of 480 = 480 \xd7 2/5 = 192 girls. Boys: 480 - 192 = 288 boys. Or: 3/5 of 480 = 288 boys directly."},{"question":"Tom saves \xa33.50 each week. How much will he have saved after 12 weeks?","solution":"\xa342.00","explanation":"Total savings = \xa33.50 \xd7 12 = \xa342.00."},{"question":"A train travels 180km in 2 hours 30 minutes. What is its average speed in km/h?","solution":"72 km/h","explanation":"Time = 2.5 hours (30 minutes = 0.5 hours). Speed = distance \xf7 time = 180 \xf7 2.5 = 72 km/h"},{"question":"Sarah has 3 times as many stickers as James. Together they have 84 stickers. How many does each have?","solution":"James: 21, Sarah: 63","explanation":"Let James have x stickers. Sarah has 3x. Total: x + 3x = 84, so 4x = 84, x = 21. James: 21, Sarah: 63"},{"question":"A rectangle\'s length is 5cm more than its width. If the perimeter is 34cm, find the dimensions.","solution":"Width: 6cm, Length: 11cm","explanation":"Let width = w. Length = w + 5. Perimeter = 2w + 2(w + 5) = 34. So 4w + 10 = 34, 4w = 24, w = 6cm. Length = 11cm"}],"exercises":[{"type":"multiple-choice","question":"A cinema has 24 rows with 18 seats in each row.
