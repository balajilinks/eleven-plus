These shortcuts work because they use number patterns and properties. Practice them until they become automatic - you\'ll save precious exam time and impress everyone with your speed. Remember: the goal is accuracy FIRST, then speed!","examples":[{"question":"Calculate 47 \xd7 11 quickly","solution":"517","explanation":"The 11 trick: For 2-digit numbers, add the digits and put the sum in the middle. 4+7=11, so write down 4, then 1+1=2, then 7. Answer: 4(1+1)7 = 517. If middle sum \u226510, carry over!"},{"question":"Find 25% of 84 instantly","solution":"21","explanation":"25% = 1/4. To find 1/4: divide by 4, OR divide by 2 twice. 84 \xf7 2 = 42, then 42 \xf7 2 = 21. Much faster than 84 \xd7 0.25!"},{"question":"Multiply 23 \xd7 99 using shortcuts","solution":"2277","explanation":"99 = 100 - 1. So 23 \xd7 99 = 23 \xd7 (100-1) = 23 \xd7 100 - 23 \xd7 1 = 2300 - 23 = 2277. Always look for numbers near 10, 100, 1000!"},{"question":"Square 35 in your head","solution":"1225","explanation":"For numbers ending in 5: Take the first digit (3), multiply by the next number (4): 3\xd74=12. Then add 25 at the end: 1225. Works for 15\xb2=225, 25\xb2=625, 45\xb2=2025!"},{"question":"Calculate 18 \xd7 15 quickly","solution":"270","explanation":"When one number ends in 5: 18 \xd7 15 = 18 \xd7 10 + 18 \xd7 5 = 180 + 90 = 270. Or: 18 \xd7 15 = 18 \xd7 (10+5) = 180 + (18\xf72\xd710) = 180 + 90 = 270"}],"exercises":[{"type":"multiple-choice","question":"Using the 11 trick, what is 34 \xd7 11?","options":["374","384","364","344"],"correct":[0],"feedback":["Correct! 3+4=7, so put 7 in middle: 3_7_4 = 374","You might have calculated 3+4+1=8, but there\'s no carrying needed here","Check the 11 trick: add the digits and put sum in middle","This would be 34 \xd7 10, not 34 \xd7 11"]},{"type":"multiple-choice","question":"What\'s the fastest way to find 75% of 60?","options":["45","40","50","55"],"correct":[0],"feedback":["Correct! 75% = 3/4.
