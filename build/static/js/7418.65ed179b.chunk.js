It stands for Brackets, Orders (powers/indices), Division and Multiplication (left to right), Addition and Subtraction (left to right). This ensures everyone gets the same answer when solving complex mathematical expressions.","questionFormations":{"description":"Order of operations questions can be presented in various formats that test understanding of calculation sequence:","types":[{"type":"Basic Mixed Operations","examples":["Calculate: 3 + 4 \xd7 5","Find: 20 - 2 \xd7 6"],"strategy":"Do multiplication/division before addition/subtraction, work left to right for same priority"},{"type":"Expressions with Brackets","examples":["Calculate: (8 + 2) \xd7 3","Find: 4 \xd7 (15 - 7) + 6"],"strategy":"Always do brackets first, then follow BODMAS for the rest"},{"type":"Powers and Indices","examples":["Calculate: 2 + 3\xb2","Find: (4 + 1)\xb2 \xd7 2"],"strategy":"Do brackets first, then powers/indices, then multiplication/division, finally addition/subtraction"},{"type":"Complex Mixed Expressions","examples":["Calculate: 24 \xf7 3 + 4 \xd7 2 - 5","Find: 2 \xd7 (6 + 4) - 3\xb2"],"strategy":"Break down step by step: brackets first, then orders, then division/multiplication (left to right), finally addition/subtraction (left to right)"},{"type":"Multiple Brackets and Nested Operations","examples":["Calculate: (12 - 4) \xf7 (3 + 1)","Find: 3 \xd7 [(8 + 2) - 4]"],"strategy":"Work from innermost brackets outward, apply BODMAS at each level"},{"type":"Common Error Identification","examples":["What\'s wrong with: 2 + 3 \xd7 4 = 5 \xd7 4 = 20?","Identify the error: (6 + 2)\xb2 = 6\xb2 + 2\xb2 = 36 + 4 = 40"],"strategy":"Understand common mistakes like doing operations left to right without considering priority"}],"examTips":["Write down BODMAS if you need to remember: Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction","Do operations of equal priority (like \xd7 and \xf7) from left to right","Show each step clearly in your working","Double-check by working through the expression again","When in doubt, use extra brackets to make the order clear","Remember that powers/indices come before multiplication"]},"examples":[{"question":"Calculate: 2 + 3 \xd7 4","solution":"2 + 12 = 14","explanation":"Multiplication comes before addition in BODMAS, so we calculate 3 \xd7 4 = 12 first, then add 2"},{"question":"Calculate: (5 + 3) \xd7 2\xb2","solution":"(5 + 3) \xd7 2\xb2 = 8 \xd7 4 = 32","explanation":"First brackets: 5 + 3 = 8.
