Effective techniques include: skimming for main ideas, scanning for specific information, eliminating subvocalization (silent pronunciation), using peripheral vision, and strategic reading patterns. The key is maintaining comprehension while increasing pace. Practice with varied text types and gradually increase speed while monitoring understanding.","examples":[{"question":"Demonstrate the \'skimming\' technique with this passage about dolphins: [300-word passage]. What are the three main points?","solution":"Main points: 1) Dolphins use echolocation for navigation, 2) They live in complex social groups, 3) They demonstrate problem-solving intelligence.","explanation":"Skimming involves reading the first and last sentences of paragraphs, topic sentences, and key words. Don\'t read every word - focus on structure and main ideas. This technique is perfect for 11+ comprehension questions asking for general understanding."},{"question":"Use \'scanning\' to find: What is the maximum speed a cheetah can reach? [In a 250-word passage about African animals]","solution":"70 mph (scanning should locate this specific detail quickly without reading the entire passage).","explanation":"Scanning involves moving your eyes rapidly over text to locate specific information. Look for numbers, proper nouns, or key terms related to your question. Don\'t get distracted by other interesting details."}],"exercises":[{"type":"multiple-choice","question":"When skimming a text for main ideas, which parts should you focus on first?","options":["Read every single word carefully","Title, first paragraph, first sentence of each paragraph, and conclusion","Only the middle paragraphs contain important information","Skip the introduction and conclusion entirely"],"correct":[1],"feedback":["This defeats the purpose of skimming, which is to read quickly for overview.","Correct! These structural elements typically contain the most important information and give you the text\'s framework.","The introduction and conclusion often contain the most crucial information.","The introduction and conclusion are usually the most important parts for understanding main ideas."]},{"type":"multiple-choice","question":"What is \'subvocalization\' and why should speed readers minimize it?","options":["Reading out loud, which should always be avoided","Silently pronouncing words in your head, which slows reading speed","Visualizing pictures while reading, which helps comprehension","Moving your lips while reading, which helps pronunciation"],"correct":[1],"feedback":["This refers to reading aloud, but subvocalization is internal pronunciation.","Correct! Subvocalization is internal speech that limits reading speed to speaking pace (about 250 words per minute).","Visualization is actually helpful - subvocalization refers to internal pronunciation.","Lip movement is a sign of subvocalization, but the term refers to the internal pronunciation."]},{"type":"select-all","question":"Which techniques can help improve reading speed while maintaining comprehension?","options":["Use a pointer or finger to guide your eyes","Read every word with equal attention","Group words into phrases rather than reading individually","Expand your peripheral vision to see more words at once"],"correct":[0,2,3],"feedback":["Correct! A guide helps maintain focus and prevents regression (re-reading).","This actually slows reading - not all words deserve equal attention.","Correct! Phrase reading is much faster than word-by-word reading.","Correct! Training peripheral vision allows you to process multiple words simultaneously."]},{"type":"multiple-choice","question":"In a 40-minute 11+ English exam with 4 passages, approximately how much time should you spend on initial skimming?","options":["15-20 minutes for thorough reading","2-3 minutes per passage for quick overview","No skimming - read everything carefully","30 seconds per passage maximum"],"correct":[1],"feedback":["This leaves insufficient time for answering questions thoroughly.","Correct! 2-3 minutes of skimming per passage gives you overview while leaving time for detailed reading and questions.","Without skimming, you might run out of time or miss the overall structure.","30 seconds is too brief to gain meaningful understanding of passage structure."]}]}')}}]);
