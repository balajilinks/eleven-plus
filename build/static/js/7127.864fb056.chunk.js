These tricks work by breaking numbers into easier parts or using special patterns. Key strategies: 1) Multiply by 10, 100, 1000 (just add zeros), 2) Double and halve method, 3) Break numbers into tens and units, 4) Use distributive property. Practice until these become automatic!","examples":[{"question":"Calculate 16 \xd7 25 using shortcuts","solution":"400","explanation":"Remember: 4 \xd7 25 = 100. Since 16 = 4 \xd7 4, we get 16 \xd7 25 = 4 \xd7 4 \xd7 25 = 4 \xd7 100 = 400. Or: 25 = 100/4, so 16 \xd7 25 = 16 \xd7 100/4 = 1600/4 = 400"},{"question":"Multiply 18 \xd7 50 quickly","solution":"900","explanation":"50 = 100/2. So 18 \xd7 50 = 18 \xd7 100/2 = 1800/2 = 900. Or think: 18 \xd7 50 = 18 \xd7 5 \xd7 10 = 90 \xd7 10 = 900"},{"question":"Use doubling/halving for 14 \xd7 15","solution":"210","explanation":"Double one, halve the other: 14 \xd7 15 = 28 \xd7 7.5. Hmm, that\'s harder! Try: 14 \xd7 15 = 7 \xd7 30 = 210. Or: 14 \xd7 15 = 14 \xd7 10 + 14 \xd7 5 = 140 + 70 = 210"},{"question":"Calculate 23 \xd7 9 using the \'subtract 1\' trick","solution":"207","explanation":"To multiply by 9: multiply by 10, then subtract the original number. 23 \xd7 10 = 230. Then 230 - 23 = 207. Works because 9 = 10 - 1!"},{"question":"Find 37 \xd7 21 by breaking down","solution":"777","explanation":"Break 21 into 20 + 1: 37 \xd7 21 = 37 \xd7 20 + 37 \xd7 1 = 740 + 37 = 777. Always break numbers into friendly parts like 10, 20, 100!"}],"exercises":[{"type":"multiple-choice","question":"Using shortcuts, calculate 24 \xd7 25","options":["600","550","650","500"],"correct":[0],"feedback":["Correct! 24 \xd7 25 = 6 \xd7 4 \xd7 25 = 6 \xd7 100 = 600 (since 4 \xd7 25 = 100)","Close, but check: 4 \xd7 25 = 100, so 24 \xd7 25 = 6 \xd7 100","Too high - remember 4 \xd7 25 = 100","Too low - this would be 20 \xd7 25"]},{"type":"multiple-choice","question":"Quick method for 17 \xd7 9","options":["153","143","163","173"],"correct":[0],"feedback":["Correct! 17 \xd7 10 = 170, then 170 - 17 = 153","You subtracted too much: should be 170 - 17","You added instead of subtracted","This would be 17 \xd7 10 + 3, not 17 \xd7 9"]},{"type":"multiple-choice","question":"Using breaking down, find 43 \xd7 11","options":["473","463","483","453"],"correct":[0],"feedback":["Correct! 43 \xd7 11 = 43 \xd7 10 + 43 \xd7 1 = 430 + 43 = 473","You calculated 43 \xd7 10 + 33 instead of 43 \xd7 10 + 43","Too high - check your addition","Too low - make sure you add 43, not 23"]},{"type":"multiple-choice","question":"Fastest way to calculate 32 \xd7 50","options":["1600","1500","1700","1400"],"correct":[0],"feedback":["Correct! 32 \xd7 50 = 32 \xd7 100/2 = 3200/2 = 1600","This would be 30 \xd7 50, not 32 \xd7 50","Too high - check your calculation","Too low - this would be 28 \xd7 50"]}]}')}}]);
