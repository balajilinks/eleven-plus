Remember the order of operations (BODMAS/PEMDAS): Brackets first, then Orders (powers), then Division and Multiplication (left to right), then Addition and Subtraction (left to right). Look for patterns that can make calculations easier, such as using the distributive property.","examples":[{"question":"Calculate: 14 \xd7 49 + 14 \xd7 51","solution":"14 \xd7 49 + 14 \xd7 51 = 14 \xd7 (49 + 51) = 14 \xd7 100 = 1400","explanation":"We can factor out the common factor 14: 14 \xd7 (49 + 51) = 14 \xd7 100 = 1400.
