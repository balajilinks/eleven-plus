In Sutton 11+ exams, you\'ll encounter biographical texts, scientific articles, historical accounts, and persuasive pieces. Success depends on quickly identifying text structure, purpose, and key information while distinguishing facts from opinions and understanding the author\'s viewpoint.","keyTechniques":[{"technique":"The Structure Detective Method","description":"Quickly identify how non-fiction texts are organized","steps":["Scan headings, subheadings, and text features first","Identify the text structure (chronological, cause-effect, compare-contrast, problem-solution)","Locate the main thesis or central argument","Find topic sentences in each paragraph","Notice how ideas connect and build upon each other"],"practicalTip":"Use the \'skeleton method\' - identify the main structure first, then fill in details. This helps you navigate quickly during exams."},{"technique":"The Purpose and Audience Analysis","description":"Understanding why the text was written and for whom","steps":["Identify the author\'s main purpose (inform, persuade, explain, argue)","Consider the intended audience (experts, general public, students)","Notice the tone and register used","Look for bias or particular viewpoints","Evaluate the credibility of sources and evidence"],"practicalTip":"Ask \'Why did the author write this?\' and \'Who are they trying to convince or inform?\' This helps you understand the text\'s angle."},{"technique":"The Fact vs Opinion Filter","description":"Distinguishing objective information from subjective views","steps":["Look for factual statements that can be verified","Identify opinion markers (believe, think, should, amazing, terrible)","Recognize expert opinions vs personal opinions","Notice persuasive language and emotional appeals","Evaluate the strength of evidence presented"],"practicalTip":"Create two mental columns: \'Can be proven\' (facts) and \'Someone\'s view\' (opinions). This helps with comprehension questions."}],"examStrategies":{"description":"Sutton 11+ non-fiction questions test your ability to extract information, understand arguments, and evaluate evidence.

First, books became much cheaper to produce, making literacy more accessible to ordinary people. As a result, ideas spread faster than ever before. This led to the Protestant Reformation, as people could read the Bible themselves.
