The height or length of each bar represents the value or frequency. Key features: title, axis labels, scale, and bars. To read: find the bar, read across to the scale. To compare: look at bar heights. Pay attention to the scale - it might not start at zero or might go up in steps other than 1.","examples":[{"question":"A bar graph shows pet ownership. The bar for dogs reaches 15 on the vertical scale. If the scale represents \'number of children\', how many children have dogs?","solution":"15 children","explanation":"Read directly from the scale where the bar ends. The bar reaches 15, so 15 children have dogs."},{"question":"In a bar graph of favorite colors, blue has 12 votes and red has 8 votes. How many more children chose blue than red?","solution":"4 more children","explanation":"Difference = 12 - 8 = 4 more children chose blue than red."}],"exercises":[{"type":"multiple-choice","question":"A bar graph shows heights of children in cm. If the scale goes up in steps of 5, and a bar reaches the 6th mark, what height does this represent?","options":["6 cm","25 cm","30 cm","35 cm"],"correct":[2],"feedback":["This doesn\'t account for the scale going up in steps of 5.","This would be if the scale started at 0 and went up in 5s, but 6th mark would be 30.","Correct! 6th mark with steps of 5: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. The 6th mark is 30 cm.","This would be the 7th mark, not the 6th."]},{"type":"select-all","question":"Looking at a bar graph of favorite subjects, which information can you find directly?","options":["Which subject is most popular","How many children chose each subject","The total number of children surveyed","The percentage who chose math"],"correct":[0,1,2],"feedback":["Correct! The tallest bar shows the most popular subject.","Correct! Read the height of each bar against the scale.","Correct! Add up all the bars to get the total.","You need to calculate this from the numbers - it\'s not directly shown."]}]}')}}]);
