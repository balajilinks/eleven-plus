The whole circle represents 100% or 360\xb0. Each sector (slice) represents a fraction or percentage of the total. To find the angle for a sector: (value \xf7 total) \xd7 360\xb0. To find the number represented by a sector: (angle \xf7 360\xb0) \xd7 total. Colors are often used to represent different categories.","questionFormations":{"description":"Pie chart questions test understanding of proportions, angles, and data interpretation:","types":[{"type":"Reading Values from Angles","examples":["Sector shows 72\xb0.
