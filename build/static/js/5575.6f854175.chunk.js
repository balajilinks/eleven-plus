The x-axis shows ranges (like ages 0-10, 10-20), and the y-axis shows frequency (how many). Unlike bar charts, the width of bars can vary. To find frequency, read the height of each bar. Total frequency = sum of all bars.","examples":[{"question":"A histogram shows student ages: 10-11 years (15 students), 11-12 years (25 students), 12-13 years (10 students). How many students in total?","solution":"50 students","explanation":"Total = 15 + 25 + 10 = 50 students. Add up all the frequencies (bar heights)."},{"question":"In the same histogram, what fraction of students are aged 11-12?","solution":"1/2 or 0.5","explanation":"11-12 age group has 25 students out of 50 total.
