The formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate (as a decimal), n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years. For simple annual compounding, A = P(1 + r)^t.","examples":[{"question":"\xa31000 is invested at 5% compound interest annually.

So A = 1000(1.05)\xb2 = \xa31102.50"},{"question":"\xa3500 grows to \xa3605 in 2 years with compound interest. What was the annual interest rate?","solution":"r = 10%","explanation":"Using A = P(1 + r)^t: 605 = 500(1 + r)\xb2. Dividing: 1.21 = (1 + r)\xb2. Taking square root: 1.1 = 1 + r.
