Ratios should be simplified to lowest terms. Proportion means ratios are equal (a:b = c:d). To solve proportion problems: cross multiply or use equivalent fractions. In problems, look for key words like \'for every\', \'to every\', or \'ratio of\'.","examples":[{"question":"Simplify the ratio 12:18","solution":"2:3","explanation":"Find the highest common factor: HCF(12,18) = 6. Divide both by 6: 12\xf76 = 2, 18\xf76 = 3. So 12:18 = 2:3"},{"question":"If 3 pens cost \xa34.50, how much do 8 pens cost?","solution":"\xa312","explanation":"Set up proportion: 3 pens : \xa34.50 = 8 pens : \xa3x. Cross multiply: 3x = 8 \xd7 4.50 = 36, so x = \xa312"}],"exercises":[{"type":"multiple-choice","question":"Simplify the ratio 20:35","options":["4:7","5:6","2:5","4:5"],"correct":[0],"feedback":["Correct! HCF(20,35) = 5, so 20:35 = 4:7","Check your division - this doesn\'t equal 20:35","This would be 8:20, not 20:35","This would be 16:20, not 20:35"]},{"type":"multiple-choice","question":"If the ratio of boys to girls is 3:4, and there are 12 boys, how many girls are there?","options":["9","16","15","18"],"correct":[1],"feedback":["This would be if the ratio was 4:3, not 3:4","Correct! If 3 parts = 12 boys, then 1 part = 4, so 4 parts = 16 girls","Check your calculation - 3:4 with 12 boys gives 16 girls","This is too many - the ratio is 3:4, not 2:3"]}]}')}}]);
