They can be factored, expanded, or solved. To expand brackets like (x+2)(x+3), use FOIL: First, Outer, Inner, Last. To factor, look for common factors first, then try to find two numbers that multiply to give \'ac\' and add to give \'b\'.","examples":[{"question":"Expand (x + 3)(x + 5)","solution":"x\xb2 + 8x + 15","explanation":"Using FOIL: First: x\xd7x = x\xb2, Outer: x\xd75 = 5x, Inner: 3\xd7x = 3x, Last: 3\xd75 = 15.
