- **Claude** (Anthropic)
- Any other AI assistant

### Step 2: Use Our Prompts
1. Open the `AI_TEST_PROMPTS.md` file in the app folder
2. Copy the appropriate prompt for your desired test type
3. Paste it into your AI tool
4. Customize subjects, difficulty, or topics as needed

### Step 3: Generate and Save
1. The AI will create a JSON file with test questions
2. Save the file in `/src/data/ai-tests/` folder
3. Use the naming convention: `ai-{subject}-{type}-{number}.json`
4. Add the import to the service file (see technical instructions)

### Step 4: Example Generation
Here's what you might say to ChatGPT:
```
"Use the Math Test Generation Prompt to create a new algebra-focused test with 20 questions for Year 6 students. Make it slightly more challenging than the basic level."
```
