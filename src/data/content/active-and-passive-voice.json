    "explanation": "Active and passive voice are fundamental grammatical structures that dramatically affect writing style and clarity. In Sutton 11+ exams, understanding voice helps students both analyze sophisticated texts and improve their own writing. Active voice creates direct, engaging prose, while passive voice can emphasize actions over actors or create formal, academic tone when used skillfully.",
