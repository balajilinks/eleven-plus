    "explanation": "Volume is the amount of space inside a 3D shape, measured in cubic units (cm³, m³). For a cuboid (rectangular prism), Volume = length × width × height. For a cube, Volume = side³. Always check the units in your answer - if measurements are in cm, volume will be in cm³. Volume tells you how much liquid or material could fit inside the shape.",
