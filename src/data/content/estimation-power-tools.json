    "explanation": "Estimation is your secret weapon in 11+ exams! When exact calculation takes too long, smart estimation gives you the answer in seconds. Plus, estimation helps you check if your exact answers are reasonable. Master these tools: 1) Round to nearest 10/100, 2) Use benchmark numbers (25, 50, 75, 100), 3) Front-end estimation, 4) Compatible numbers, 5) Order of magnitude checks. Trust your estimates!",

            "question": "Estimate 47 × 23 quickly",
            "solution": "About 1000",
            "explanation": "Round both: 47 ≈ 50, 23 ≈ 20. So 50 × 20 = 1000. (Exact answer is 1081, so very close!) Always round to numbers that multiply easily."

            "question": "Estimate 897 ÷ 31 in seconds",
            "solution": "About 30",
            "explanation": "Round: 897 ≈ 900, 31 ≈ 30. So 900 ÷ 30 = 30. (Exact is 28.9, so excellent estimate!) Round divisor to factors of dividend when possible."

            "question": "Quick estimate: 68% of 291",
            "solution": "About 200",
            "explanation": "68% ≈ 70%, 291 ≈ 300. So 70% of 300 = 0.7 × 300 = 210. Round to 200 for quick estimate. (Exact: 197.88)"

            "question": "Estimate the sum: 187 + 234 + 156",
            "solution": "About 580",
            "explanation": "Front-end estimation: 100 + 200 + 100 = 400. Then adjust: 87 + 34 + 56 ≈ 180. Total: 400 + 180 = 580. (Exact: 577)"

            "question": "Is 15² closer to 200 or 250?",
            "solution": "Closer to 200",
            "explanation": "15² = (10 + 5)² ≈ 10² + 2×10×5 = 100 + 100 = 200. (Exact: 225). Or think: 15 is halfway between 10 and 20, and 10²=100, 20²=400, so 15² ≈ 225, closer to 200."
