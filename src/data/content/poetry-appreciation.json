    "explanation": "Poetry in the 11+ exam requires special reading skills. Unlike prose, poetry uses concentrated language, rhythm, and imagery to create meaning. Sutton examiners look for students who can understand both the literal meaning and the deeper emotional or thematic content. Success comes from recognizing poetic devices and understanding how they create effects.",
