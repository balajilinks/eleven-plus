    "explanation": "Simple interest is calculated using the formula: Interest = Principal × Rate × Time. Principal is the original amount, Rate is the percentage per year (as a decimal), and Time is in years. Simple interest doesn't compound - it's calculated only on the original amount. Total amount = Principal + Interest.",
