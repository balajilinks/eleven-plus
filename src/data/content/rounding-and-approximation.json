    "title": "Rounding and Approximation",
    "explanation": "Rounding is making a number simpler while keeping it close to its original value. We can round to the nearest 10, 100, 1000, or to a certain number of decimal places or significant figures. Rules: If the digit is 5 or more, round up. If it's less than 5, round down. Approximation helps us estimate answers quickly.",

            "question": "Round 3,847 to the nearest 100",
            "solution": "3,800",
            "explanation": "Look at the tens digit (4). Since 4 < 5, round down. The hundreds digit stays 8, so the answer is 3,800."

            "solution": "7.35",
            "explanation": "Look at the third decimal place (8). Since 8 ≥ 5, round up. The second decimal place becomes 5, so the answer is 7.35."

            "question": "Round 0.00456 to 2 significant figures",
            "solution": "0.0046",
            "explanation": "The first significant figure is 4, the second is 5. Look at the third (6). Since 6 ≥ 5, round up the 5 to 6, giving 0.0046."
