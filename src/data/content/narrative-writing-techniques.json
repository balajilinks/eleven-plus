    "explanation": "Narrative writing techniques are essential tools for creating engaging, sophisticated stories that demonstrate 11+ level writing ability. Key techniques include: varied sentence structures for rhythm and pace, show-don't-tell descriptions, effective dialogue, strong opening hooks, well-developed characters, vivid setting descriptions, and satisfying conclusions. Advanced writers use literary devices like foreshadowing, symbolism, and varied narrative perspectives to create depth and meaning.",
    "examples": [
        {
            "question": "Improve this weak opening: 'It was a dark night. Tom was scared. He walked down the street.'",
            "solution": "The streetlights flickered ominously as Tom hurried along the deserted pavement, every shadow seeming to reach toward him with ghostly fingers.",
            "explanation": "This improved version uses: vivid imagery ('flickered ominously'), personification ('ghostly fingers'), specific details ('deserted pavement'), and varied sentence structure to create atmosphere and engage the reader immediately."
        },
        {
            "question": "Demonstrate 'show, don't tell' by rewriting: 'Sarah was very angry.'",
            "solution": "Sarah's hands clenched into tight fists, her face flushed crimson, and she spoke through gritted teeth.",
            "explanation": "Instead of telling the reader Sarah is angry, we show her anger through physical actions and descriptions that allow readers to infer her emotional state, making the writing more engaging and vivid."
