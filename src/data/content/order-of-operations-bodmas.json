    "explanation": "BODMAS is the order in which mathematical operations should be performed. It stands for Brackets, Orders (powers/indices), Division and Multiplication (left to right), Addition and Subtraction (left to right). This ensures everyone gets the same answer when solving complex mathematical expressions.",
