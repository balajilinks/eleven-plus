    "explanation": "Authorial intent questions ask you to consider why an author chose specific words, phrases, or techniques. Authors make deliberate choices to create effects such as: creating atmosphere, showing character emotions, emphasizing points, or engaging the reader. Look for: word choice, sentence structure, literary devices, and punctuation choices. Consider the effect these choices have on the reader.",
    "examples": [
        {
            "question": "In the sentence 'The door creaked ominously as Sarah pushed it open,' why did the author use the word 'ominously'?",
            "solution": "To create a sense of foreboding and suggest something bad might happen.",
            "explanation": "The author chose 'ominously' to create tension and suggest danger, making the reader feel worried about what Sarah might find."

        {
            "question": "Why might an author use ellipses (...) in dialogue like 'I thought you were... never mind'?",
            "solution": "To show hesitation, trailing off, or that the character is leaving something unsaid.",
            "explanation": "Ellipses show that the character stops speaking, suggesting they're uncertain, don't want to finish their thought, or are being interrupted."

            "options": [
                "To show the wind was loud",
                "To create a threatening, supernatural atmosphere",

                "While 'howled' suggests loudness, the main effect is more dramatic.",
                "Correct! 'Howled like a banshee' creates a spooky, threatening atmosphere.",
                "'Howled' describes sound, not direction.",
