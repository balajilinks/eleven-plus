    "explanation": "Patterns are regular sequences or arrangements that repeat or follow a rule. Look for: what increases/decreases, by how much, what stays the same. Number patterns can involve +, -, ×, ÷, or squaring. Shape patterns might rotate, flip, or change size/color. Finding the rule helps predict what comes next!",

            "solution": "162",
            "explanation": "Each term is multiplied by 3: 2×3=6, 6×3=18, 18×3=54, so 54×3=162"

            "solution": "36 (square numbers)",
            "explanation": "These are square numbers: 1²=1, 2²=4, 3²=9, 4²=16, 5²=25, so next is 6²=36"
