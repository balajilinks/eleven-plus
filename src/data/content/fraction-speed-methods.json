    "explanation": "Fractions don't have to be slow! Master these quick methods and solve fraction problems in half the time. Key tricks: 1) Cross multiply for comparisons, 2) Find common denominators using LCM shortcuts, 3) Convert to decimals when easier, 4) Use unit fractions (1/2, 1/3, 1/4) as building blocks, 5) Simplify before calculating. Remember: every fraction question has a fast route!",

            "explanation": "LCM of 8 and 12: 8 = 2³, 12 = 2² × 3, so LCM = 24. Quick method: 3/8 = 9/24, 5/12 = 10/24, so 9/24 + 10/24 = 19/24. Always find LCM by prime factors!"
