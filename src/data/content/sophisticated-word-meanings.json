    "explanation": "11+ examinations require understanding of sophisticated vocabulary beyond everyday words. These are challenging but age-appropriate words that demonstrate linguistic maturity. Focus on: precise definitions, subtle distinctions between similar words, contextual usage, and etymology. Understanding sophisticated vocabulary shows intellectual development and enhances both comprehension and expression in academic contexts.",

            "question": "What does 'perspicacious' mean, and how would you use it in context?",
            "solution": "Perspicacious means having keen insight and understanding; being perceptive and astute.",
            "explanation": "Example usage: 'The perspicacious detective noticed the subtle inconsistency in the witness's testimony.' It derives from Latin 'perspicax' meaning 'seeing through clearly'. This word shows sophisticated thinking ability."

        {
            "question": "Explain the difference between 'ubiquitous' and 'common'.",
            "solution": "While both suggest widespread presence, 'ubiquitous' means present everywhere simultaneously, whereas 'common' simply means frequently encountered.",
            "explanation": "'Ubiquitous' suggests omnipresence (like air or gravity), while 'common' indicates frequency. Example: 'Mobile phones are ubiquitous in modern society' vs 'Mobile phones are common among teenagers'."
