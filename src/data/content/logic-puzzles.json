    "explanation": "Logic puzzles require systematic thinking and careful analysis of given information. Common types include: counting problems (heads and legs), sequence problems, and constraint satisfaction. Key strategies: organize information clearly, work step by step, check your answer makes sense, and use elimination to narrow down possibilities. Draw diagrams or tables if helpful.",

        {
            "question": "In a yard, there are chickens and cats. There are 20 heads and 54 legs in total. How many chickens and how many cats are there?",
            "solution": "13 chickens and 7 cats",
            "explanation": "Each animal has 1 head. Chickens have 2 legs, cats have 4 legs. If all were chickens: 20 × 2 = 40 legs. We need 54 - 40 = 14 more legs. Each cat gives 2 extra legs, so 14 ÷ 2 = 7 cats. Therefore: 7 cats and 13 chickens."

            "question": "Three friends have ages that are consecutive even numbers. Their ages sum to 60. How old are they?",
            "solution": "18, 20, and 22 years old",
            "explanation": "Let the ages be n, n+2, n+4. Then n + (n+2) + (n+4) = 60, so 3n + 6 = 60, so 3n = 54, so n = 18. Ages are 18, 20, 22."
