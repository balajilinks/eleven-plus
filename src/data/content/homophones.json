    "explanation": "Homophones are words that sound the same but have different meanings and often different spellings. Common examples include: there/their/they're, to/too/two, hear/here, write/right, know/no, and where/wear. Understanding homophones is crucial for spelling and comprehension. Context helps determine which homophone to use.",
