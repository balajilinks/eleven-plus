    "explanation": "To find a fraction of a quantity, multiply the quantity by the fraction. For example, 1/4 of 20 = 20 × 1/4 = 5. You can also divide by the denominator and multiply by the numerator. For more complex fractions like 'a fraction of a fraction', multiply the fractions together first, then multiply by the quantity.",

            "explanation": "3/4 of 60 = 60 × 3/4 = (60 × 3) ÷ 4 = 180 ÷ 4 = 45. Or: 1/4 of 60 = 15, so 3/4 = 3 × 15 = 45."
