    "explanation": "Unit conversions involve changing from one unit of measurement to another. Key conversions: 1 hour = 60 minutes, 1 minute = 60 seconds, 1 meter = 100 centimeters, 1 kilometer = 1000 meters, 1 kilogram = 1000 grams. To convert: multiply when going to smaller units, divide when going to larger units. Speed = distance ÷ time.",
