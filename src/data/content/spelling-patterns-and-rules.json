    "explanation": "English spelling follows certain patterns and rules, though there are exceptions. Key rules include: 'i before e except after c' (believe, receive), adding '-ing' (drop final 'e', double final consonant in short words), plurals (add 's' or 'es'), and prefix/suffix patterns. Learning these patterns helps with spelling unfamiliar words.",

            "solution": "Calendar (not Calender)",
            "explanation": "Remember: 'Calendar' has 'a' in the middle, not 'e'. Think of 'Cal-a-ndar' to remember the 'a'."
