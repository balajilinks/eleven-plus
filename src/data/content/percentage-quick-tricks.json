    "explanation": "Percentages appear everywhere in 11+ exams! Master these quick tricks and you'll solve percentage problems in seconds instead of minutes. The secret is knowing that percentages are just fractions in disguise. Learn these key percentages as fractions: 10%=1/10, 20%=1/5, 25%=1/4, 50%=1/2, 75%=3/4. Then use mental math tricks!",

        {
            "question": "Find 15% of 80 in 3 seconds",
            "solution": "12",
            "explanation": "15% = 10% + 5%. First find 10%: move decimal left (80→8). Then 5% = half of 10%: 8÷2=4. So 15% = 8+4 = 12. Super fast!"
        },
        {
            "question": "What's 37% of 200 quickly?",
            "solution": "74",
            "explanation": "With nice round numbers like 200, just multiply the percentage by the hundreds digit: 37 × 2 = 74. Works because 37% of 200 = 37 × 200/100 = 37 × 2."
        },
        {
            "question": "Calculate 250% of 24",
            "solution": "60",
            "explanation": "250% = 2.5 times. To multiply by 2.5: double it, then add half. 24×2=48. Half of 24=12. So 48+12=60. Much easier than 24×2.5!"
        },
        {
            "question": "Find what percentage 18 is of 24",
            "solution": "75%",
            "explanation": "Quick method: 18/24 = 3/4 (divide both by 6). And 3/4 = 75%. Always look for common factors to simplify fractions first!"
        },
        {
            "question": "Increase 60 by 25% instantly",
            "solution": "75",
            "explanation": "25% = 1/4. So 25% of 60 = 60÷4 = 15. Adding 25% means 60+15 = 75. Or think: 125% of 60 = 1.25×60 = 60 + 60/4 = 75"
