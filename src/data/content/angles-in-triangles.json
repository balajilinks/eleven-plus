    "explanation": "The angles in any triangle always add up to 180°. Special triangles include: Equilateral (all angles 60°), Isosceles (two equal angles), Right-angled (one 90° angle), and Scalene (all angles different). In an isosceles triangle, the two base angles are equal. In a right-angled triangle, the other two angles add up to 90°.",

            "explanation": "All angles in a triangle sum to 180°. Third angle = 180° - 45° - 65° = 70°."

            "solution": "Either 40° and 100°, or both 70°",
            "explanation": "If the 40° angle is one of the equal angles, the other equal angle is also 40°, and the third is 180° - 40° - 40° = 100°. If 40° is the different angle, the other two are each (180° - 40°) ÷ 2 = 70°."
