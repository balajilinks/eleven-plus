    "explanation": "Quadratic expressions have the form ax² + bx + c, where a ≠ 0. They can be factored, expanded, or solved. To expand brackets like (x+2)(x+3), use FOIL: First, Outer, Inner, Last. To factor, look for common factors first, then try to find two numbers that multiply to give 'ac' and add to give 'b'.",

            "solution": "x² + 8x + 15",
            "explanation": "Using FOIL: First: x×x = x², Outer: x×5 = 5x, Inner: 3×x = 3x, Last: 3×5 = 15. Combine: x² + 5x + 3x + 15 = x² + 8x + 15"

            "explanation": "Need two numbers that multiply to 12 and add to 7. These are 3 and 4. So x² + 7x + 12 = (x + 3)(x + 4)"
