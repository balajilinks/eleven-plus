    "explanation": "Trigonometry is the study of triangles and the relationships between their angles and sides. The three main trigonometric ratios are sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan). In a right triangle: sin θ = opposite/hypotenuse, cos θ = adjacent/hypotenuse, tan θ = opposite/adjacent. Remember SOH-CAH-TOA!",

            "explanation": "Using CAH: cos θ = adjacent/hypotenuse, so 4/5 = adjacent/10. Cross multiply: 4 × 10 = 5 × adjacent, so adjacent = 40/5 = 8"
