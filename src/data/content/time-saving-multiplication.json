    "explanation": "Multiplication shortcuts can save you minutes in 11+ exams! These tricks work by breaking numbers into easier parts or using special patterns. Key strategies: 1) Multiply by 10, 100, 1000 (just add zeros), 2) Double and halve method, 3) Break numbers into tens and units, 4) Use distributive property. Practice until these become automatic!",

            "question": "Calculate 16 × 25 using shortcuts",
            "solution": "400",
            "explanation": "Remember: 4 × 25 = 100. Since 16 = 4 × 4, we get 16 × 25 = 4 × 4 × 25 = 4 × 100 = 400. Or: 25 = 100/4, so 16 × 25 = 16 × 100/4 = 1600/4 = 400"

            "question": "Multiply 18 × 50 quickly",
            "solution": "900",
            "explanation": "50 = 100/2. So 18 × 50 = 18 × 100/2 = 1800/2 = 900. Or think: 18 × 50 = 18 × 5 × 10 = 90 × 10 = 900"

            "solution": "210",
            "explanation": "Double one, halve the other: 14 × 15 = 28 × 7.5. Hmm, that's harder! Try: 14 × 15 = 7 × 30 = 210. Or: 14 × 15 = 14 × 10 + 14 × 5 = 140 + 70 = 210"

            "solution": "207",
            "explanation": "To multiply by 9: multiply by 10, then subtract the original number. 23 × 10 = 230. Then 230 - 23 = 207. Works because 9 = 10 - 1!"

            "explanation": "Break 21 into 20 + 1: 37 × 21 = 37 × 20 + 37 × 1 = 740 + 37 = 777. Always break numbers into friendly parts like 10, 20, 100!"
