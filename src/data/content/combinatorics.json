    "explanation": "Combinatorics is about counting arrangements and combinations. When arranging objects in order, multiply the choices: 3 books can be arranged in 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways. When choosing groups without order mattering, use combinations. Think systematically and list possibilities when numbers are small!",
