    "explanation": "Solving equations means finding the value of a variable that makes the equation true. Key strategies: 1) Use inverse operations (opposite operations) to isolate the variable, 2) Whatever you do to one side, do to the other, 3) Work systematically: first remove any terms from the variable side, then remove numbers from the variable side, 4) Always check your answer by substituting back. Common types include one-step, two-step, and multi-step equations.",
