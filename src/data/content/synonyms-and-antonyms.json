    "explanation": "Synonyms are words with similar meanings (big/large, happy/joyful). Antonyms are words with opposite meanings (hot/cold, fast/slow). Understanding these relationships helps with vocabulary building and reading comprehension. Context is important - some words can have different synonyms depending on how they're used. For example, 'bright' could mean intelligent (synonym: clever) or well-lit (synonym: illuminated).",
