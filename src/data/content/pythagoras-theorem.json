    "explanation": "Pythagoras Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side, opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The formula is: a² + b² = c², where c is the hypotenuse and a and b are the other two sides.",

            "solution": "c² = 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25, so c = 5",
            "explanation": "Using a² + b² = c²: 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25. Taking the square root: √25 = 5. The hypotenuse is 5."
