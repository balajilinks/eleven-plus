    "explanation": "Pythagoras Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side, opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The formula is: a + b = c, where c is the hypotenuse and a and b are the other two sides.",

            "solution": "c = 3 + 4 = 9 + 16 = 25, so c = 5",
            "explanation": "Using a + b = c: 3 + 4 = 9 + 16 = 25. Taking the square root: 25 = 5. The hypotenuse is 5."

            "explanation": "Using Pythagoras: height + 6 = 10. So height = 100 - 36 = 64. Therefore height = 64 = 8m."
