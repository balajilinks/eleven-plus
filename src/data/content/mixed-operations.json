    "explanation": "Mixed operations involve combining addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in a single calculation. Remember the order of operations (BODMAS/PEMDAS): Brackets first, then Orders (powers), then Division and Multiplication (left to right), then Addition and Subtraction (left to right). Look for patterns that can make calculations easier, such as using the distributive property.",

            "solution": "14 × 49 + 14 × 51 = 14 × (49 + 51) = 14 × 100 = 1400",
            "explanation": "We can factor out the common factor 14: 14 × (49 + 51) = 14 × 100 = 1400. This is much easier than calculating 14 × 49 = 686 and 14 × 51 = 714, then adding them."

            "explanation": "When dividing by a decimal, multiply both numbers by 10 to make the divisor a whole number: 140 ÷ 0.7 = 1400 ÷ 7 = 200."
