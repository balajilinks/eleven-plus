    "explanation": "Decimals and fractions are two ways to represent parts of a whole. Decimals use a point to separate the whole number from the fractional part (e.g., 0.5), while fractions use a numerator and denominator (e.g., 1/2). You can convert between them and use the same operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).",
