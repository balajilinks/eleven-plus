    "explanation": "Decimals, fractions, and percentages are three ways to represent parts of a whole or values less than one. Decimals use a point to separate the whole number from the fractional part (e.g., 0.75), fractions use numerator and denominator (e.g., 3/4), and percentages show parts per hundred (e.g., 75%). You can convert between all three formats and perform operations with them. Key conversions: Fraction to decimal (divide), decimal to percentage (multiply by 100), percentage to fraction (over 100, then simplify).",
