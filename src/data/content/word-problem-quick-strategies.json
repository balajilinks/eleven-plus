    "explanation": "Word problems can be solved lightning-fast with the right strategies! The key is pattern recognition - most 11+ word problems follow just 6 main types. Learn to spot these patterns instantly: 1) Find the total (add), 2) Find the difference (subtract), 3) Equal sharing (divide), 4) Groups of items (multiply), 5) Parts of whole (fractions/percentages), 6) Before/after changes. Read, identify the pattern, solve!",

            "question": "Tom has 3 times as many cards as Sam. Together they have 48 cards. How many does Tom have?",
            "solution": "36 cards",
            "explanation": "PATTERN: 'Times as many' + 'together' = ratio problem. If Sam has x, Tom has 3x. Total: x + 3x = 48, so 4x = 48, x = 12. Tom has 3 × 12 = 36. Quick method: Tom gets 3 parts out of 4 total parts, so 3/4 × 48 = 36!"

            "question": "A shop reduces prices by 20%. A jacket now costs £32. What was the original price?",
            "solution": "£40",
            "explanation": "PATTERN: 'Reduced by %' = working backwards. £32 is 80% of original (100% - 20% = 80%). Quick method: If 80% = £32, then 10% = £4, so 100% = £40. Or: £32 ÷ 0.8 = £40"

            "question": "A train travels 240km in 3 hours. How long for 400km at the same speed?",
            "solution": "5 hours",
            "explanation": "PATTERN: Speed-distance-time. Speed = 240 ÷ 3 = 80 km/h. Time for 400km = 400 ÷ 80 = 5 hours. Quick method: 400 ÷ 240 = 5/3, so time = 3 × 5/3 = 5 hours"

            "explanation": "PATTERN: Ratio problems. Total parts = 2 + 3 = 5. Boys get 2 parts out of 5. Quick method: 2/5 × 30 = 12 boys. Always find total parts first!"

            "solution": "8 weeks",
            "explanation": "PATTERN: 'At least' means minimum. £40 ÷ £5 = 8 weeks exactly. So 8 weeks gives exactly £40, which satisfies 'at least £40'. Watch for 'at least', 'at most', 'more than'!"
