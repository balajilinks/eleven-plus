    "explanation": "Pie charts show data as parts of a whole circle. The whole circle represents 100% or 360°. Each sector (slice) represents a fraction or percentage of the total. To find the angle for a sector: (value ÷ total) × 360°. To find the number represented by a sector: (angle ÷ 360°) × total. Colors are often used to represent different categories.",

            "question": "In a pie chart showing favorite colors, blue takes up 90° of the circle. If 200 children were surveyed, how many chose blue?",
            "solution": "50 children",
            "explanation": "90° out of 360° = 90/360 = 1/4 of the circle. 1/4 of 200 children = 50 children chose blue."
