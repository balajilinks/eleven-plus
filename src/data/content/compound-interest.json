    "title": "Compound Interest",
    "explanation": "Compound interest is interest calculated on the initial principal plus all previously earned interest. The formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate (as a decimal), n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years. For simple annual compounding, A = P(1 + r)^t.",

            "solution": "A = 1000(1 + 0.05)² = 1000(1.05)² = 1000 × 1.1025 = £1102.50",
            "explanation": "Using A = P(1 + r)^t: P = £1000, r = 0.05, t = 2. So A = 1000(1.05)² = £1102.50"

            "explanation": "Using A = P(1 + r)^t: 605 = 500(1 + r)². Dividing: 1.21 = (1 + r)². Taking square root: 1.1 = 1 + r. So r = 0.1 = 10%"

            "explanation": "Compound: 800(1.06)³ = £953.24. Simple: 800 + (800 × 0.06 × 3) = £944. Difference: £953.24 - £944 = £9.24"
