    "explanation": "Compound interest is interest calculated on the initial principal plus all previously earned interest. The formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate (as a decimal), n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years. For simple annual compounding, A = P(1 + r)^t.",
