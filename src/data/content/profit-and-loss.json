    "explanation": "Profit is when you sell something for more than you paid for it. Loss is when you sell for less. Cost Price (CP) is what you pay, Selling Price (SP) is what you sell for. Profit = SP - CP. Loss = CP - SP. Percentage profit = (Profit ÷ CP) × 100. This is useful for understanding business and money in real life!",
