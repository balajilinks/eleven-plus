    "explanation": "Direct proportion: as one quantity increases, the other increases at the same rate (y = kx). Inverse proportion: as one quantity increases, the other decreases (y = k/x). Examples: Direct - more workers, more work done. Inverse - more speed, less time taken. Look for constant ratios (direct) or constant products (inverse).",

            "solution": "£5",
            "explanation": "Direct proportion: cost ÷ apples is constant. £2 ÷ 4 = £0.50 per apple. So 10 apples = 10 × £0.50 = £5"

            "solution": "4 days",
            "explanation": "Inverse proportion: workers × days is constant. 6 × 8 = 48. So 12 workers take 48 ÷ 12 = 4 days"
