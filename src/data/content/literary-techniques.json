    "explanation": "Literary techniques are methods writers use to create effects and convey meaning. Common techniques include: Alliteration (repeating initial sounds), Simile (comparing using 'like' or 'as'), Metaphor (direct comparison), Personification (giving human qualities to non-human things), Hyperbole (exaggeration), Onomatopoeia (words that sound like their meaning), and Repetition (repeating words for emphasis).",

            "question": "Identify the literary technique in: 'The wind whispered through the trees.'",
            "solution": "Personification",
            "explanation": "The wind is given the human ability to whisper, which is personification - giving human characteristics to non-human things."

            "explanation": "This repeats the 'p' sound at the beginning of most words, which is alliteration."
