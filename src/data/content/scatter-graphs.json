    "explanation": "Scatter graphs show the relationship between two variables using dots plotted on a coordinate grid. Each dot represents one data point with x and y coordinates. Look for: positive correlation (as one increases, the other increases), negative correlation (as one increases, the other decreases), or no correlation (no clear pattern). Trends help predict values and identify outliers.",

            "question": "A scatter graph shows height vs. shoe size. What type of correlation would you expect?",
            "solution": "Positive correlation",
            "explanation": "Generally, taller people have larger feet, so as height increases, shoe size tends to increase too. This is positive correlation."

            "question": "In a scatter graph of swimming times vs. age for children, what correlation might you see?",
            "solution": "Negative correlation",
            "explanation": "As children get older, they usually get faster at swimming, so their times get shorter. This means as age increases, swimming time decreases - negative correlation."
