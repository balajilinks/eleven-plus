    "explanation": "Bar graphs (or bar charts) use rectangular bars to show data. The height or length of each bar represents the value or frequency. Key features: title, axis labels, scale, and bars. To read: find the bar, read across to the scale. To compare: look at bar heights. Pay attention to the scale - it might not start at zero or might go up in steps other than 1.",
