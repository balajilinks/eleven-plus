    "explanation": "Prime numbers have exactly two factors: 1 and themselves. They cannot be divided evenly by any other number. Square numbers are the result of multiplying a number by itself (e.g., 4 = 2²). Cube numbers are the result of multiplying a number by itself three times (e.g., 8 = 2³). Note: 1 is neither prime nor composite, and 2 is the only even prime number.",

            "solution": "2",
            "explanation": "2 is the smallest prime number because it only has two factors: 1 and 2. Note that 1 is not considered a prime number."

            "question": "What is the largest square number less than 50?",
            "solution": "49 (which is 7²)",
            "explanation": "The square numbers less than 50 are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49. The largest is 49 = 7 × 7."

            "explanation": "The cube numbers are: 1 (1³), 8 (2³), 27 (3³), 64 (4³)... The smallest cube number greater than 10 is 27."
