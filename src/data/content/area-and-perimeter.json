    "explanation": "Area is the amount of space inside a shape (measured in square units like cm²). Perimeter is the distance around the outside of a shape (measured in linear units like cm). For rectangles: Area = length × width, Perimeter = 2 × (length + width). For irregular shapes, break them into simpler shapes or use the given measurements carefully.",

            "solution": "Area = 8 × 5 = 40 cm². Perimeter = 2 × (8 + 5) = 2 × 13 = 26 cm.",
            "explanation": "Area is length × width. Perimeter is the total distance around the outside, which is 2 × (length + width) for a rectangle."
