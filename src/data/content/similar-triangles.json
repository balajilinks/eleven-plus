    "explanation": "Similar triangles have the same shape but different sizes. All corresponding angles are equal, and all corresponding sides are in the same ratio (scale factor). If triangles are similar, you can find missing sides using ratios. This is useful for measuring heights using shadows!",

        {
            "question": "Two similar triangles have sides 6cm, 8cm, 10cm and 9cm, 12cm, ?cm. Find the missing side.",
            "solution": "15cm",
            "explanation": "Scale factor = 9 ÷ 6 = 1.5. So the missing side = 10 × 1.5 = 15cm. Check: 6×1.5=9 ✓, 8×1.5=12 ✓"

            "question": "A 2m tall boy casts a 3m shadow. A tree casts a 12m shadow. How tall is the tree?",
            "solution": "8m",
            "explanation": "The triangles are similar. Ratio = height ÷ shadow. Boy: 2 ÷ 3. Tree: ? ÷ 12. So tree height = (2 ÷ 3) × 12 = 8m"
