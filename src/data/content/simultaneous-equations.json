    "title": "Simultaneous Equations",
    "explanation": "Simultaneous equations are two or more equations that must be satisfied at the same time. They contain two or more unknown variables. To solve them, we can use substitution method (solve one equation for one variable, then substitute into the other) or elimination method (add or subtract equations to eliminate one variable).",
    "examples": [
        {
            "question": "Solve: x + y = 5 and x - y = 1",
            "solution": "x = 3, y = 2",
            "explanation": "Using elimination: Add the equations: (x + y) + (x - y) = 5 + 1, so 2x = 6, therefore x = 3. Substitute back: 3 + y = 5, so y = 2."

            "question": "Solve: 2x + y = 7 and x + y = 4",
            "solution": "x = 3, y = 1",
            "explanation": "Using elimination: Subtract second from first: (2x + y) - (x + y) = 7 - 4, so x = 3. Substitute back: 3 + y = 4, so y = 1."

            "question": "Solve: y = 2x + 1 and x + y = 7",
            "solution": "x = 2, y = 5",
            "explanation": "Using substitution: Replace y in second equation: x + (2x + 1) = 7, so 3x + 1 = 7, therefore 3x = 6, so x = 2. Then y = 2(2) + 1 = 5."
