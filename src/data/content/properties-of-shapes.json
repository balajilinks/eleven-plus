    "explanation": "Different shapes have specific properties: lines of symmetry, rotational symmetry, parallel sides, equal sides, and diagonals. A kite has two pairs of adjacent equal sides and one line of symmetry. A rhombus has all sides equal and two lines of symmetry. A trapezium has one pair of parallel sides. A parallelogram has opposite sides equal and parallel, with no lines of symmetry but rotational symmetry of order 2.",
