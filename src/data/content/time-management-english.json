    "explanation": "Time management is often the difference between success and failure in Sutton 11+ English exams. Even brilliant students can underperform if they can't manage time effectively. The ability to allocate time wisely, work efficiently under pressure, and prioritize tasks demonstrates the self-discipline and strategic thinking that grammar schools highly value.",
