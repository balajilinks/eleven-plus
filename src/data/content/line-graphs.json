    "explanation": "Line graphs show how data changes over time. Points are joined with lines to show trends. Look for: increasing (going up), decreasing (going down), steady (flat), or patterns. Read values by going up from the x-axis and across from the y-axis. Steep lines show rapid change, gentle slopes show gradual change.",

            "solution": "2.5°C per hour",
            "explanation": "Temperature increase = 25°C - 20°C = 5°C. Time = 4pm - 2pm = 2 hours. Rate = 5°C ÷ 2 hours = 2.5°C per hour"
