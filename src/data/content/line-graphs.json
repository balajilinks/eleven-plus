    "explanation": "Line graphs show how data changes over time. Points are joined with lines to show trends. Look for: increasing (going up), decreasing (going down), steady (flat), or patterns. Read values by going up from the x-axis and across from the y-axis. Steep lines show rapid change, gentle slopes show gradual change.",
