    "explanation": "A percentage is a way of expressing a number as a part of 100. To find a percentage of a number, you can use two methods: 1) Convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100, then multiply by the number. 2) Use the formula: (percentage ÷ 100) × number. Remember: 'percent' means 'per hundred', so 25% means 25 out of every 100.",

            "solution": "35% = 35 ÷ 100 = 0.35. Then: 0.35 × 8 = £2.80.",
            "explanation": "We convert 35% to a decimal (0.35) and multiply by the amount."

            "question": "What is 95% of 860?",

            "explanation": "Another way: 95% = 100% - 5%, so 860 - (5% of 860) = 860 - 43 = 817."
