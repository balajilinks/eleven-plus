Key skills: calculating total costs, finding change, working with different prices, and handling discounts. Remember: pounds have 100 pence, always work to 2 decimal places for money, and check your answers make sense in real-world contexts.",

            "explanation": "7 × £2.99 = £20.93. You can calculate this as 7 × 3 = 21, then subtract 7 × 0.01 = 0.07, giving £21.00 - £0.07 = £20.93."

            "explanation": "2 adults: 2 × £8.50 = £17.00. 3 children: 3 × £5.25 = £15.75. Total: £17.00 + £15.75 = £32.75."
