    "explanation": "Probability is the chance or likelihood that something will happen. It's measured on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 means impossible and 1 means certain. Probability = Number of favorable outcomes รท Total number of possible outcomes. It can also be expressed as a fraction, percentage, or decimal.",

            "question": "What's the probability of rolling a 6 on a fair dice?",
            "solution": "1/6 or 0.167 or 16.7%",
            "explanation": "There is 1 favorable outcome (rolling a 6) out of 6 possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). So P(6) = 1/6."

            "question": "What's the probability of picking a red card from a standard deck?",
            "solution": "1/2 or 0.5 or 50%",
            "explanation": "There are 26 red cards (13 hearts + 13 diamonds) out of 52 total cards. So P(red) = 26/52 = 1/2."

            "question": "A bag contains 3 red balls, 2 blue balls, and 5 green balls. What's the probability of picking a blue ball?",
            "solution": "2/10 = 1/5 or 0.2 or 20%",
            "explanation": "There are 2 blue balls out of 10 total balls (3 + 2 + 5 = 10). So P(blue) = 2/10 = 1/5."
