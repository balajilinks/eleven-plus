    "explanation": "Factors are numbers that divide exactly into another number. Multiples are the result of multiplying a number by integers. To find the Lowest Common Multiple (LCM), list multiples of each number until you find the smallest one they share. To find the Highest Common Factor (HCF), list factors of each number and find the largest one they share.",
