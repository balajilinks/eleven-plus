    "explanation": "Inequalities compare values using >, <, ≥, ≤ symbols. > means 'greater than', < means 'less than', ≥ means 'greater than or equal to', ≤ means 'less than or equal to'. Solve like equations, but if you multiply or divide by a negative number, flip the inequality sign!",

            "question": "Solve: x + 5 > 12",
            "solution": "x > 7",
            "explanation": "Subtract 5 from both sides: x + 5 - 5 > 12 - 5, so x > 7. This means x can be any number greater than 7."

            "solution": "x ≤ 5",
            "explanation": "Divide both sides by 3: 3x ÷ 3 ≤ 15 ÷ 3, so x ≤ 5. This means x can be 5 or any number less than 5."
