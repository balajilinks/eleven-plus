    "explanation": "When comparing style and setting across texts, examine: writing style (formal/informal, descriptive/simple, first/third person), tone (serious/humorous, dark/light), setting (time period, location, atmosphere), and how these elements affect the mood and meaning. Look for similarities and differences in how authors create atmosphere, develop settings, and use language techniques.",

            "question": "Compare the writing styles of a diary entry and a newspaper article about the same event.",
            "solution": "The diary entry would be personal, informal, and emotional, while the newspaper article would be objective, formal, and factual.",
            "explanation": "Diary entries use first person, personal opinions, and informal language. Newspaper articles use third person, present facts objectively, and use formal language."

            "explanation": "Misselthwaite Manor has secret passages and a hidden garden, while Hogwarts has moving staircases and hidden rooms. Both settings encourage exploration and discovery."
