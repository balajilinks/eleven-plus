2. Verify your AI server is running (for local providers)
3. Test the connection in Settings
4. Check the console for any error messages

### üìö Example Interactions

**Student**: "I don't understand fractions"
**AI Tutor**: "Let me help you with fractions! Think of a fraction like a pizza. If you have 1/2, it means you have 1 piece out of 2 total pieces. Would you like me to show you some examples?"

**Student**: "Help with this math problem"
**AI Tutor**: "I'd be happy to help! Instead of giving you the answer, let me guide you through it step by step. What do you think the first step should be?"

### üéØ Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: "Help with multiplication tables" works better than "help with math"
2. **Ask Questions**: The AI loves when students ask "why" and "how"
3. **Practice Together**: Use the AI to generate practice questions
4. **Review Mistakes**: Ask the AI to explain why an answer was wrong

Enjoy your enhanced learning experience! üéì‚ú®
