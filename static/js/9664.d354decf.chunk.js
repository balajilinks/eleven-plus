Ratios should be simplified to lowest terms. Proportion means ratios are equal (a:b = c:d). To solve proportion problems: cross multiply or use equivalent fractions. In problems, look for key words like \'for every\', \'to every\', or \'ratio of\'.","questionFormations":{"description":"Ratio and proportion questions can be presented in various formats that test understanding of comparative relationships:","types":[{"type":"Simplifying Ratios","examples":["Simplify the ratio 15:25","Express 18:27:36 in its simplest form"],"strategy":"Find the highest common factor (HCF) of all numbers, divide each number by the HCF"},{"type":"Finding Missing Values in Proportions","examples":["If 5 pencils cost \xa33, how much do 12 pencils cost?","3 men can build a wall in 8 days.
