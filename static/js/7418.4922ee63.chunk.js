This ensures everyone gets the same answer when solving complex mathematical expressions.","examples":[{"question":"Calculate: 2 + 3 \xd7 4","solution":"2 + 12 = 14","explanation":"Multiplication comes before addition in BODMAS, so we calculate 3 \xd7 4 = 12 first, then add 2"},{"question":"Calculate: (5 + 3) \xd7 2\xb2","solution":"(5 + 3) \xd7 2\xb2 = 8 \xd7 4 = 32","explanation":"First brackets: 5 + 3 = 8.
