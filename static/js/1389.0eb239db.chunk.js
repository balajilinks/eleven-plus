In Sutton 11+ exams, this skill separates exceptional students from good ones. Critical readers question assumptions, evaluate evidence, recognize bias, and form independent judgments. This sophisticated approach to reading is exactly what grammar schools value most in their students.","keyTechniques":[{"technique":"The Question Everything Approach","description":"Develop a questioning mindset while reading","steps":["Ask \'Who wrote this and why?\'","Question \'What evidence supports these claims?\'","Consider \'What viewpoints are missing?\'","Evaluate \'How reliable is this information?\'","Reflect \'How does this connect to what I already know?\'"],"practicalTip":"Keep a mental list of questions as you read: Who? What? Why? How? When? What if? This keeps your mind actively engaged."},{"technique":"The Evidence Evaluation System","description":"Assess the quality and reliability of information presented","steps":["Identify what type of evidence is presented (statistics, expert opinions, examples)","Consider the source\'s credibility and potential bias","Look for gaps or missing information","Evaluate whether evidence actually supports the conclusions","Notice persuasive techniques that might influence judgment"],"practicalTip":"Strong evidence is specific, verifiable, and comes from credible sources. Weak evidence is vague, unverifiable, or biased."},{"technique":"The Multiple Perspectives Method","description":"Consider different viewpoints and interpretations","steps":["Identify the main perspective presented in the text","Consider what other viewpoints might exist on this topic","Look for any acknowledgment of opposing views","Evaluate how fairly different perspectives are represented","Form your own balanced view based on the evidence"],"practicalTip":"Ask \'Who might disagree with this?\' and \'What would they say?\' This helps you think beyond the author\'s perspective."}],"examStrategies":{"description":"Sutton 11+ critical reading questions test your ability to analyze texts objectively, evaluate arguments, and form independent judgments.
