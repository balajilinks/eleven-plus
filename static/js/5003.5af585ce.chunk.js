Key strategies: 1) Break the problem into smaller steps, 2) Work through each step carefully, 3) Use the answer from one step in the next step, 4) Check each step makes sense, 5) Verify your final answer. Remember the order of operations (BODMAS) and consider whether to work with exact values or round at the end.","examples":[{"question":"A box contains 144 chocolates arranged in 12 rows.
