This is essential for using mathematical formulas in real life. Follow the order of operations (BODMAS/PEMDAS): Brackets, Orders (powers), Division/Multiplication (left to right), Addition/Subtraction (left to right). Be careful with negative numbers, use brackets when substituting negatives, and always show your working step by step. Common formulas include area, perimeter, speed, and algebraic expressions.","questionFormations":{"description":"Substitution in formulas questions can be presented in various formats that test understanding of variables and mathematical operations:","types":[{"type":"Simple Algebraic Substitution","examples":["If a = 3 and b = 5, find 2a + 3b","Given x = 4 and y = -2, calculate x\xb2 - 3y"],"strategy":"Replace each variable with its value, use brackets for negatives, follow BODMAS"},{"type":"Geometric Formula Substitution","examples":["Area of triangle A = \xbdbh.
