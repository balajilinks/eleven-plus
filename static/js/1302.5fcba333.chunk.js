For a cuboid (rectangular prism), Volume = length \xd7 width \xd7 height. For a cube, Volume = side\xb3. Always check the units in your answer - if measurements are in cm, volume will be in cm\xb3. Volume tells you how much liquid or material could fit inside the shape.","examples":[{"question":"What is the volume of a cuboid with length 6 cm, width 4 cm, and height 3 cm?","solution":"72 cm\xb3","explanation":"Volume = length \xd7 width \xd7 height = 6 \xd7 4 \xd7 3 = 72 cm\xb3"},{"question":"A cube has sides of 5 cm.
