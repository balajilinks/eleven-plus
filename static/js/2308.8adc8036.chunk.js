Look for: what increases/decreases, by how much, what stays the same. Number patterns can involve +, -, \xd7, \xf7, or squaring. Shape patterns might rotate, flip, or change size/color. Finding the rule helps predict what comes next!","examples":[{"question":"Find the next term in the sequence: 2, 6, 18, 54, ?","solution":"162","explanation":"Each term is multiplied by 3: 2\xd73=6, 6\xd73=18, 18\xd73=54, so 54\xd73=162"},{"question":"What\'s the pattern in: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ?","solution":"36 (square numbers)","explanation":"These are square numbers: 1\xb2=1, 2\xb2=4, 3\xb2=9, 4\xb2=16, 5\xb2=25, so next is 6\xb2=36"}],"exercises":[{"type":"multiple-choice","question":"Find the next number in the sequence: 3, 7, 15, 31, ?","options":["63","47","39","55"],"correct":[0],"feedback":["Correct!
