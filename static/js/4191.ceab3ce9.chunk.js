They form straight lines when graphed. Standard form: y = mx + c, where m is the slope (gradient) and c is the y-intercept. To solve linear equations: 1) Expand any brackets, 2) Collect like terms, 3) Get all terms with the variable on one side, 4) Get all number terms on the other side, 5) Divide to find the variable. Always check your answer by substituting back into the original equation.","examples":[{"question":"Solve: 3x + 7 = 22","solution":"x = 5","explanation":"3x + 7 = 22 \u2192 3x = 22 - 7 \u2192 3x = 15 \u2192 x = 5.
