They cannot be divided evenly by any other number. Square numbers are the result of multiplying a number by itself (e.g., 4 = 2\xb2). Cube numbers are the result of multiplying a number by itself three times (e.g., 8 = 2\xb3). Note: 1 is neither prime nor composite, and 2 is the only even prime number.","examples":[{"question":"What is the smallest prime number?","solution":"2","explanation":"2 is the smallest prime number because it only has two factors: 1 and 2. Note that 1 is not considered a prime number."},{"question":"What is the largest square number less than 50?","solution":"49 (which is 7\xb2)","explanation":"The square numbers less than 50 are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49. The largest is 49 = 7 \xd7 7."},{"question":"What is the smallest cube number greater than 10?","solution":"27 (which is 3\xb3)","explanation":"The cube numbers are: 1 (1\xb3), 8 (2\xb3), 27 (3\xb3), 64 (4\xb3)...
