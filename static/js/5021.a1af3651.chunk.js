The height or length of each bar represents the value or frequency. Key features: title, axis labels, scale, and bars. To read: find the bar, read across to the scale. To compare: look at bar heights. Pay attention to the scale - it might not start at zero or might go up in steps other than 1.","questionFormations":{"description":"Bar graph questions in 11+ exams test data reading and comparison skills:","types":[{"type":"Reading Single Values","examples":["How many people chose chocolate as their favorite flavor?","What was the rainfall in June?"],"strategy":"Find the correct bar, read across to the scale value"},{"type":"Comparing Two Values","examples":["How many more votes did football get than tennis?","Which month had twice as much rainfall as May?"],"strategy":"Read both values, calculate the difference or ratio"},{"type":"Finding Totals","examples":["What was the total number of votes cast?","How much rainfall was there in the first quarter?"],"strategy":"Add up all relevant bar values"},{"type":"Ordering and Ranking","examples":["List the sports in order of popularity","Which was the third most popular choice?"],"strategy":"Compare bar heights and arrange from highest to lowest"},{"type":"Scale Interpretation","examples":["If each square represents 5 people, how many chose swimming?","The scale goes up in steps of 10.
