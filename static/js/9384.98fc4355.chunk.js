When subtracting times, if the end minutes are smaller than the start minutes, borrow 1 hour (60 minutes) from the hours. Convert between 12-hour and 24-hour formats when needed. Remember: there are 60 minutes in an hour, and times can cross from AM to PM or from one day to the next.","examples":[{"question":"What is the time difference between 8:57 AM and 1:28 PM?","solution":"4 hours 31 minutes","explanation":"From 8:57 AM to 1:28 PM: 8:57 AM to 9:00 AM = 3 minutes, 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM = 4 hours, 1:00 PM to 1:28 PM = 28 minutes.
