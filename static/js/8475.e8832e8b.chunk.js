They contain an independent clause and one or more dependent clauses, connected by subordinating conjunctions (because, although, when, if, since, while, etc.). Understanding complex structures helps with: reading comprehension of sophisticated texts, writing with variety and precision, and analyzing authorial techniques. Master the relationships: cause/effect, contrast, time, condition, and purpose.","examples":[{"question":"Identify the dependent clause in: \'Although the storm raged fiercely outside, the children felt safe and warm inside the cottage.\'","solution":"\'Although the storm raged fiercely outside\' is the dependent clause.","explanation":"This clause begins with \'Although\' (subordinating conjunction) and cannot stand alone as a complete sentence. It provides contrasting information to the main clause \'the children felt safe and warm inside the cottage.\'"},{"question":"Combine these simple sentences into one complex sentence: \'The scientist made a discovery. The discovery would change medical understanding. She worked tirelessly for years.\'","solution":"After working tirelessly for years, the scientist made a discovery that would change medical understanding.","explanation":"This combines all three ideas using \'After\' (time relationship) and \'that\' (relative clause) to create one sophisticated sentence showing the relationships between the ideas."}],"exercises":[{"type":"multiple-choice","question":"Which sentence correctly uses a complex structure to show cause and effect?","options":["The concert was cancelled and everyone was disappointed.","Because of heavy rain, the concert was cancelled, disappointing everyone.","The concert was cancelled.
