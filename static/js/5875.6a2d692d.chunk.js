To find a percentage of a number, you can use two methods: 1) Convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100, then multiply by the number. 2) Use the formula: (percentage \xf7 100) \xd7 number. Remember: \'percent\' means \'per hundred\', so 25% means 25 out of every 100.","questionFormations":{"description":"Percentage questions test calculation skills and real-world application in various contexts:","types":[{"type":"Basic Percentage Calculations","examples":["Find 25% of 80","What is 15% of \xa3240?"],"strategy":"Convert to decimal (25% = 0.25) and multiply, or use (25\xf7100) \xd7 80"},{"type":"Percentage Increase/Decrease","examples":["Price increased from \xa350 to \xa360, what percentage increase?","Population fell from 2000 to 1800, what percentage decrease?"],"strategy":"Find difference, then (difference \xf7 original) \xd7 100"},{"type":"Finding the Original Amount","examples":["After 20% discount, cost is \xa380, what was original price?","15% of a number is 45, what is the number?"],"strategy":"Work backwards: If 80% = \xa380, then 100% = \xa380 \xf7 0.8 = \xa3100"},{"type":"VAT and Sales Tax","examples":["Item costs \xa360 plus 20% VAT, find total","Total bill \xa3144 including 20% VAT, find pre-VAT amount"],"strategy":"Add VAT: multiply by 1.2.
