They contain two or more unknown variables. To solve them, we can use substitution method (solve one equation for one variable, then substitute into the other) or elimination method (add or subtract equations to eliminate one variable).","examples":[{"question":"Solve: x + y = 5 and x - y = 1","solution":"x = 3, y = 2","explanation":"Using elimination: Add the equations: (x + y) + (x - y) = 5 + 1, so 2x = 6, therefore x = 3. Substitute back: 3 + y = 5, so y = 2."},{"question":"Two numbers have a sum of 15 and a difference of 3. Find both numbers.","solution":"The numbers are 9 and 6","explanation":"Let the numbers be x and y. Then x + y = 15 and x - y = 3. Adding equations: 2x = 18, so x = 9.
