Key strategies: 1) Read carefully and identify what you\'re looking for, 2) Identify the given information, 3) Decide which operations to use, 4) Work step by step, 5) Check your answer makes sense in the context. Look for key words like \'total\' (add), \'difference\' (subtract), \'each\' (divide), \'altogether\' (add), \'left\' (subtract), \'more than\' (add), \'less than\' (subtract), \'times as many\' (multiply), \'shared equally\' (divide). Always check units and whether your answer is reasonable.","examples":[{"question":"A school has 480 students. 2/5 of them are girls. How many boys are there?","solution":"288 boys","explanation":"Girls: 2/5 of 480 = 480 \xd7 2/5 = 192 girls. Boys: 480 - 192 = 288 boys. Or: 3/5 of 480 = 288 boys directly."},{"question":"Tom saves \xa33.50 each week. How much will he have saved after 12 weeks?","solution":"\xa342.00","explanation":"Total savings = \xa33.50 \xd7 12 = \xa342.00."},{"question":"A train travels 180km in 2 hours 30 minutes. What is its average speed in km/h?","solution":"72 km/h","explanation":"Time = 2.5 hours (30 minutes = 0.5 hours). Speed = distance \xf7 time = 180 \xf7 2.5 = 72 km/h"},{"question":"Sarah has 3 times as many stickers as James. Together they have 84 stickers. How many does each have?","solution":"James: 21, Sarah: 63","explanation":"Let James have x stickers. Sarah has 3x. Total: x + 3x = 84, so 4x = 84, x = 21. James: 21, Sarah: 63"},{"question":"A rectangle\'s length is 5cm more than its width. If the perimeter is 34cm, find the dimensions.","solution":"Width: 6cm, Length: 11cm","explanation":"Let width = w. Length = w + 5. Perimeter = 2w + 2(w + 5) = 34. So 4w + 10 = 34, 4w = 24, w = 6cm. Length = 11cm"},{"question":"A shop sells apples at \xa32.40 per kg. If Mrs Smith pays \xa37.20, how many kg of apples did she buy?","solution":"3 kg","explanation":"Amount of apples = Total cost \xf7 Price per kg = \xa37.20 \xf7 \xa32.40 = 3 kg"},{"question":"In a school, 3/8 of the 560 students are boys. How many girls are there?","solution":"350 girls","explanation":"Boys: 3/8 \xd7 560 = 210. Girls: 560 - 210 = 350. Or directly: 5/8 \xd7 560 = 350"},{"question":"A train leaves at 09:45 and arrives at 14:20. If it makes a 25-minute stop, how long was the actual traveling time?","solution":"4 hours 10 minutes","explanation":"Total journey time: 14:20 - 09:45 = 4h 35min.
