The whole circle represents 100% or 360\xb0. Each sector (slice) represents a fraction or percentage of the total. To find the angle for a sector: (value \xf7 total) \xd7 360\xb0. To find the number represented by a sector: (angle \xf7 360\xb0) \xd7 total. Colors are often used to represent different categories.","examples":[{"question":"In a pie chart showing favorite colors, blue takes up 90\xb0 of the circle. If 200 children were surveyed, how many chose blue?","solution":"50 children","explanation":"90\xb0 out of 360\xb0 = 90/360 = 1/4 of the circle. 1/4 of 200 children = 50 children chose blue."},{"question":"A pie chart shows that 3/8 of students like math.
