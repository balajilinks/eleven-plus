Inverse proportion: as one quantity increases, the other decreases (y = k/x). Examples: Direct - more workers, more work done. Inverse - more speed, less time taken. Look for constant ratios (direct) or constant products (inverse).","examples":[{"question":"If 4 apples cost \xa32, how much do 10 apples cost? (Direct proportion)","solution":"\xa35","explanation":"Direct proportion: cost \xf7 apples is constant. \xa32 \xf7 4 = \xa30.50 per apple. So 10 apples = 10 \xd7 \xa30.50 = \xa35"},{"question":"If 6 workers take 8 days to complete a job, how long will 12 workers take? (Inverse proportion)","solution":"4 days","explanation":"Inverse proportion: workers \xd7 days is constant. 6 \xd7 8 = 48. So 12 workers take 48 \xf7 12 = 4 days"}],"exercises":[{"type":"multiple-choice","question":"5 identical books weigh 2kg. What do 8 books weigh? (Direct proportion)","options":["3.2kg","2.5kg","4kg","3kg"],"correct":[0],"feedback":["Correct! 2kg \xf7 5 = 0.4kg per book. So 8 books = 8 \xd7 0.4kg = 3.2kg","This doesn\'t follow the direct proportion correctly","Too high - check: 5 books = 2kg, so 8 books = ?","Close, but not quite right. Use the ratio method."]},{"type":"multiple-choice","question":"A car traveling at 60 mph takes 3 hours for a journey. How long at 90 mph? (Inverse)","options":["2 hours","4.5 hours","1.5 hours","4 hours"],"correct":[0],"feedback":["Correct! Speed \xd7 time = constant. 60 \xd7 3 = 180. So 90 \xd7 ? = 180, giving 2 hours","This is for direct proportion, but speed and time are inversely related","Too short - check the inverse proportion calculation","This doesn\'t follow the inverse proportion rule"]}]}')}}]);
