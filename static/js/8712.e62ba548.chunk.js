To convert: Fraction to decimal: divide the numerator by the denominator. Decimal to percentage: multiply by 100. Percentage to fraction: write as a fraction over 100, then simplify. Remember common equivalents: 1/2 = 0.5 = 50%, 1/4 = 0.25 = 25%, 3/4 = 0.75 = 75%.","examples":[{"question":"Convert 0.0125 to a fraction in its simplest form.","solution":"0.0125 = 1.25/100 = 125/10000 = 1/80","explanation":"0.0125 = 1.25/100. To remove decimals, multiply by 100: 125/10000. Then simplify by dividing both by 125: 1/80."},{"question":"What is 3/8 as a decimal and percentage?","solution":"3/8 = 0.375 = 37.5%","explanation":"Divide 3 by 8 to get 0.375.
