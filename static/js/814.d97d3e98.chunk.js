Linear equations have variables to the power of 1 only. Key strategies: 1) Use inverse operations (opposite operations) to isolate the variable, 2) Whatever you do to one side, do to the other, 3) Work systematically: expand brackets, collect like terms, get variables on one side, numbers on the other, 4) Always check your answer by substituting back. These form the foundation for all algebraic problem-solving.","questionFormations":{"description":"Equation solving questions can be presented in various formats that test systematic algebraic thinking:","types":[{"type":"One-Step Equations","examples":["Solve: x + 7 = 15","Find y: 3y = 21"],"strategy":"Use single inverse operation to isolate the variable"},{"type":"Two-Step Equations","examples":["Solve: 2x + 5 = 17","Find a: 4a - 9 = 11"],"strategy":"Remove the constant first, then remove the coefficient"},{"type":"Equations with Variables on Both Sides","examples":["Solve: 3x + 2 = x + 10","Find y: 5y - 3 = 2y + 9"],"strategy":"Collect all variables on one side, constants on the other, then solve"},{"type":"Equations with Brackets","examples":["Solve: 3(x + 4) = 21","Find t: 2(3t - 1) = 16"],"strategy":"Expand brackets first, then use standard solving techniques"},{"type":"Real-World Applications","examples":["A number increased by 8 equals 23.
