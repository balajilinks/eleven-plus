Key rules: Divisible by 2 (even numbers), by 3 (sum of digits divisible by 3), by 4 (last two digits divisible by 4), by 5 (ends in 0 or 5), by 6 (divisible by both 2 and 3), by 9 (sum of digits divisible by 9), by 10 (ends in 0).","examples":[{"question":"Is 738 divisible by 3?","solution":"Yes, because 7 + 3 + 8 = 18, and 18 is divisible by 3.","explanation":"To check divisibility by 3, add all the digits.
