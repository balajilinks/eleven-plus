Look for patterns, make connections, and justify your answers. Ask: \'Does this make sense?\' Break complex problems into smaller parts. Use what you know to figure out what you don\'t know. Always check your answer!","examples":[{"question":"Tom has \xa320. He buys 3 items costing \xa34, \xa37, and \xa36. Does he have enough money left to buy a \xa35 chocolate bar?","solution":"No, he needs \xa32 more","explanation":"Cost of 3 items: \xa34 + \xa37 + \xa36 = \xa317. Money left: \xa320 - \xa317 = \xa33. Chocolate costs \xa35, but he only has \xa33, so he needs \xa32 more."},{"question":"Sarah says \'I\'m thinking of a number. If I double it and add 7, I get 23.\' What\'s her number?","solution":"8","explanation":"Work backwards: 23 - 7 = 16, then 16 \xf7 2 = 8.
