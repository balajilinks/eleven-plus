To simplify expressions: 1) Remove brackets by multiplying out (expanding), 2) Collect like terms (terms with the same variable), 3) Add or subtract coefficients of like terms. Remember: when multiplying by a negative number, change all the signs inside the brackets. Variables represent unknown numbers that can change. Coefficients are the numbers in front of variables (in 3x, the coefficient is 3).","examples":[{"question":"Simplify: 4y + 2 - 3(y - 2)","solution":"4y + 2 - 3(y - 2) = 4y + 2 - 3y + 6 = y + 8","explanation":"First, expand the bracket: -3(y - 2) = -3y + 6.
