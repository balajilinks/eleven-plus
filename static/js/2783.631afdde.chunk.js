Unlike mathematical problems with single answers, fiction analysis requires you to think critically, make connections, and support your ideas with evidence from the text. These skills help you tackle any story, from classic literature to modern novels.","keyTechniques":[{"technique":"Character Analysis Framework","description":"Systematic approach to understanding characters","steps":["What they say and do (direct characterization)","How others react to them (indirect characterization)","Their motivations and conflicts","How they change throughout the story","What they represent or symbolize"],"practicalTip":"Create a character web: put the character in the center, then add spokes for appearance, personality, relationships, conflicts, and growth."},{"technique":"Plot Structure Recognition","description":"Understanding how stories are built","steps":["Exposition: Setting and character introduction","Rising Action: Building tension and conflict","Climax: The turning point or most intense moment","Falling Action: Consequences of the climax","Resolution: How conflicts are resolved"],"practicalTip":"Draw a plot mountain while reading - this helps you identify where you are in the story and predict what might happen next."},{"technique":"Theme Identification Strategy","description":"Finding the deeper meanings in stories","steps":["Look for repeated ideas, words, or symbols","Ask: What is the author trying to teach us?","Consider universal human experiences (love, loss, growing up, justice)","Notice how the main character changes - what do they learn?","Connect the story to real life situations"],"practicalTip":"Themes are usually life lessons that can be stated as complete sentences: \'True friendship requires sacrifice\' not just \'friendship\'."}],"examStrategies":{"description":"Strategic approaches for fiction questions in 11+ exams","timeManagement":{"readingTime":"10-15 minutes for careful first read","analysisTime":"5 minutes for planning answers","writingTime":"15-20 minutes for detailed responses","reviewTime":"3-5 minutes for checking and improving"},"questionTypes":[{"type":"Character Motivation Questions","approach":"Use evidence from the text to explain WHY characters act as they do","example":"\'Why does Sarah decide to help the stranger?\' - Look for clues about her personality, past experiences, and values","trickToAvoid":"Don\'t just describe what happens - explain the reasons behind actions"},{"type":"Language Effect Questions","approach":"Explain HOW the author\'s word choices create specific effects","example":"\'How does the author create suspense in this passage?\' - Look for short sentences, mysterious words, incomplete information","trickToAvoid":"Don\'t just identify techniques - explain their impact on the reader"},{"type":"Inference Questions","approach":"Use clues from the text plus your own knowledge to read between the lines","example":"\'What can we infer about the relationship between Tom and his father?\' - Look for hints in dialogue, actions, and reactions","trickToAvoid":"Stay close to the text - don\'t make wild guesses without evidence"}]},"practicalExercises":[{"title":"Character Detective","instruction":"Read this passage and become a character detective.

The acceptance letter lay crumpled on her desk - the university she\'d dreamed of attending since she was twelve. But how could she leave now?

Emma picked up the phone to call her best friend, then set it down again. What was the point? Nobody would understand.","questions":["What kind of person is Emma?
