When exact calculation takes too long, smart estimation gives you the answer in seconds. Plus, estimation helps you check if your exact answers are reasonable. Master these tools: 1) Round to nearest 10/100, 2) Use benchmark numbers (25, 50, 75, 100), 3) Front-end estimation, 4) Compatible numbers, 5) Order of magnitude checks. Trust your estimates!","examples":[{"question":"Estimate 47 \xd7 23 quickly","solution":"About 1000","explanation":"Round both: 47 \u2248 50, 23 \u2248 20. So 50 \xd7 20 = 1000. (Exact answer is 1081, so very close!) Always round to numbers that multiply easily."},{"question":"Estimate 897 \xf7 31 in seconds","solution":"About 30","explanation":"Round: 897 \u2248 900, 31 \u2248 30. So 900 \xf7 30 = 30. (Exact is 28.9, so excellent estimate!) Round divisor to factors of dividend when possible."},{"question":"Quick estimate: 68% of 291","solution":"About 200","explanation":"68% \u2248 70%, 291 \u2248 300. So 70% of 300 = 0.7 \xd7 300 = 210. Round to 200 for quick estimate. (Exact: 197.88)"},{"question":"Estimate the sum: 187 + 234 + 156","solution":"About 580","explanation":"Front-end estimation: 100 + 200 + 100 = 400. Then adjust: 87 + 34 + 56 \u2248 180. Total: 400 + 180 = 580. (Exact: 577)"},{"question":"Is 15\xb2 closer to 200 or 250?","solution":"Closer to 200","explanation":"15\xb2 = (10 + 5)\xb2 \u2248 10\xb2 + 2\xd710\xd75 = 100 + 100 = 200. (Exact: 225). Or think: 15 is halfway between 10 and 20, and 10\xb2=100, 20\xb2=400, so 15\xb2 \u2248 225, closer to 200."}],"exercises":[{"type":"multiple-choice","question":"Best estimate for 38 \xd7 19","options":["800","600","1000","400"],"correct":[0],"feedback":["Correct! 38 \u2248 40, 19 \u2248 20, so 40 \xd7 20 = 800","This would be 30 \xd7 20 = 600, but 38 is closer to 40","Too high - this would be 50 \xd7 20","Too low - this would be 20 \xd7 20"]},{"type":"multiple-choice","question":"Estimate 789 \xf7 19","options":["40","30","50","35"],"correct":[0],"feedback":["Correct! 789 \u2248 800, 19 \u2248 20, so 800 \xf7 20 = 40","This would be 600 \xf7 20, but 789 is closer to 800","This would be 1000 \xf7 20, too high","This would be 700 \xf7 20, but 789 rounds to 800"]},{"type":"multiple-choice","question":"Quick estimate: 32% of 248","options":["80","100","60","120"],"correct":[0],"feedback":["Correct! 32% \u2248 30%, 248 \u2248 250. 30% of 250 = 75 \u2248 80","This would be 40% of 250, too high","This would be 25% of 240, too low","This would be 50% of 240, way too high"]},{"type":"multiple-choice","question":"Estimate 156 + 287 + 194","options":["640","600","680","700"],"correct":[0],"feedback":["Correct! 156\u2248160, 287\u2248290, 194\u2248190. 160+290+190=640","This rounds too much down - closer to 640","This adds about 40 too much","This is too high - would need numbers closer to 230 each"]}]}')}}]);
