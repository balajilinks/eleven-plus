Key strategies: 1) Read carefully and identify what you\'re looking for, 2) Identify the given information, 3) Decide which operations to use, 4) Work step by step, 5) Check your answer makes sense in the context. Look for key words like \'total\' (add), \'difference\' (subtract), \'each\' (divide), \'altogether\' (add), \'left\' (subtract), \'more than\' (add), \'less than\' (subtract), \'times as many\' (multiply), \'shared equally\' (divide). Always check units and whether your answer is reasonable.","questionFormations":{"description":"Word problems can be presented in various formats that test the ability to translate real-world situations into mathematics:","types":[{"type":"Addition and Subtraction Problems","examples":["Tom has 45 stickers.

How many boys are there?","solution":"288 boys","explanation":"Girls: 2/5 of 480 = 480 \xd7 2/5 = 192 girls. Boys: 480 - 192 = 288 boys.
