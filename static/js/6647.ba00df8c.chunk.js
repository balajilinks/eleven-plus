A net is a 2D pattern that can be folded to make a 3D shape. Common 3D shapes: cube (6 square faces), cuboid (6 rectangular faces), pyramid (triangle faces meeting at a point), cylinder (2 circles + curved surface), sphere (perfectly round ball).","examples":[{"question":"How many faces does a triangular pyramid have?","solution":"4 faces","explanation":"A triangular pyramid has 1 triangular base + 3 triangular sides = 4 faces total.
