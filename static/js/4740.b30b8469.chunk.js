They are written with a minus sign (-) in front. Think of them as being on the left side of zero on a number line. They are useful for representing things like temperatures below freezing, depths below sea level, or debts.","examples":[{"question":"What is -5 + 3?","solution":"-5 + 3 = -2","explanation":"Start at -5 on the number line and move 3 places to the right (positive direction).
