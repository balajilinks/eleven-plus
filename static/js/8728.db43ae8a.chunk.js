Points are joined with lines to show trends. Look for: increasing (going up), decreasing (going down), steady (flat), or patterns. Read values by going up from the x-axis and across from the y-axis. Steep lines show rapid change, gentle slopes show gradual change.","questionFormations":{"description":"Line graph questions in 11+ exams test data interpretation and trend analysis skills:","types":[{"type":"Reading Values","examples":["What was the temperature at 3pm?","How many books were sold in March?"],"strategy":"Find the x-value, go up to the line, then across to the y-axis to read the value"},{"type":"Calculating Change","examples":["By how much did sales increase from January to March?","What was the rate of temperature rise per hour?"],"strategy":"Find difference between values, divide by time period for rates"},{"type":"Identifying Trends","examples":["Describe the trend in population from 2010 to 2020","In which period was the steepest increase?"],"strategy":"Look for patterns: increasing, decreasing, steady, or varying.
