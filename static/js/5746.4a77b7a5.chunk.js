The key is pattern recognition - most 11+ word problems follow just 6 main types. Learn to spot these patterns instantly: 1) Find the total (add), 2) Find the difference (subtract), 3) Equal sharing (divide), 4) Groups of items (multiply), 5) Parts of whole (fractions/percentages), 6) Before/after changes. Read, identify the pattern, solve!","examples":[{"question":"Tom has 3 times as many cards as Sam. Together they have 48 cards. How many does Tom have?","solution":"36 cards","explanation":"PATTERN: \'Times as many\' + \'together\' = ratio problem. If Sam has x, Tom has 3x. Total: x + 3x = 48, so 4x = 48, x = 12. Tom has 3 \xd7 12 = 36. Quick method: Tom gets 3 parts out of 4 total parts, so 3/4 \xd7 48 = 36!"},{"question":"A shop reduces prices by 20%. A jacket now costs \xa332. What was the original price?","solution":"\xa340","explanation":"PATTERN: \'Reduced by %\' = working backwards. \xa332 is 80% of original (100% - 20% = 80%). Quick method: If 80% = \xa332, then 10% = \xa34, so 100% = \xa340. Or: \xa332 \xf7 0.8 = \xa340"},{"question":"A train travels 240km in 3 hours. How long for 400km at the same speed?","solution":"5 hours","explanation":"PATTERN: Speed-distance-time. Speed = 240 \xf7 3 = 80 km/h. Time for 400km = 400 \xf7 80 = 5 hours. Quick method: 400 \xf7 240 = 5/3, so time = 3 \xd7 5/3 = 5 hours"},{"question":"In a class of 30, the ratio of boys to girls is 2:3. How many boys?","solution":"12 boys","explanation":"PATTERN: Ratio problems. Total parts = 2 + 3 = 5. Boys get 2 parts out of 5. Quick method: 2/5 \xd7 30 = 12 boys. Always find total parts first!"},{"question":"Sarah saves \xa35 weekly. After how many weeks will she have at least \xa340?","solution":"8 weeks","explanation":"PATTERN: \'At least\' means minimum. \xa340 \xf7 \xa35 = 8 weeks exactly. So 8 weeks gives exactly \xa340, which satisfies \'at least \xa340\'. Watch for \'at least\', \'at most\', \'more than\'!"}],"exercises":[{"type":"multiple-choice","question":"Emma spends 2/5 of her money on books and has \xa318 left.
