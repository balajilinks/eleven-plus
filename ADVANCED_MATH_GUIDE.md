# Advanced 11+ Mathematics Topics - Quick Reference

## ðŸŽ¯ Topics with Complete Content

### 1. Order of Operations (BODMAS)
- **B**rackets first
- **O**rders (powers/indices)
- **D**ivision and **M**ultiplication (left to right)
- **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (left to right)
- Example: 2 + 3 Ã— 4 = 2 + 12 = 14

### 2. Negative Numbers
- Numbers less than zero
- Rules: negative Ã— negative = positive, negative Ã— positive = negative
- Example: -5 + 3 = -2, -2 Ã— -3 = 6

### 3. Rounding and Approximation
- Round to nearest 10, 100, 1000, or decimal places
- Rule: 5 or more rounds up, less than 5 rounds down
- Example: 3,847 â†’ 3,800 (nearest 100)

### 4. Highest Common Factor (HCF)
- Largest number that divides all given numbers
- Find by listing factors or using division method
- Example: HCF of 12 and 18 = 6

### 5. Compound Interest
- Interest on principal plus previously earned interest
- Formula: A = P(1 + r)^t
- Example: Â£1000 at 5% for 2 years = Â£1102.50

### 6. Speed Distance Time
- Speed = Distance Ã· Time
- Distance = Speed Ã— Time
- Time = Distance Ã· Speed
- Example: 150 km in 3 hours = 50 km/h

### 7. Simultaneous Equations
- Two equations solved together
- Methods: substitution or elimination
- Example: x + y = 5, x - y = 1 â†’ x = 3, y = 2

### 8. Pythagoras Theorem
- aÂ² + bÂ² = cÂ² (for right triangles)
- c is the hypotenuse (longest side)
- Example: 3Â² + 4Â² = 5Â²

### 9. Trigonometry Basics
- SOH-CAH-TOA
- sin Î¸ = opposite/hypotenuse
- cos Î¸ = adjacent/hypotenuse
- tan Î¸ = opposite/adjacent

### 10. Probability
- P = favorable outcomes Ã· total outcomes
- Scale: 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain)
- Example: P(heads) = 1/2
